# Experiment: exp_20250904_190938

**Domain**: Deep Learning - Variational Autoencoders  
**Hypothesis**: H1 & H2 - Active enforcement of distributional assumptions via DERP prevents VAE posterior collapse more effectively than passive KL regularization alone  
**Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (2,000 sample subset)  
**Method**: DERP-VAE vs Standard VAE comparison  

## Research Questions
1. Can active distribution enforcement through random probe testing prevent posterior collapse on real-world image data?
2. Does DERP-VAE maintain reconstruction quality while preventing collapse on CIFAR-10?
3. What is the computational overhead of distributional enforcement with real image data?

## Expected Outcomes
- >50% reduction in posterior collapse (measured by KL divergence to prior)
- <10% degradation in reconstruction quality
- <20% increase in training time vs baseline VAE

## Experimental Design
**Independent Variables**:
- Enforcement method: {Standard VAE, β-VAE, DERP-VAE}
- Random probe count: {3, 5} projections  
- Enforcement weight λ: {0.1, 0.5, 1.0}

**Dependent Variables**:
- KL divergence to prior (posterior collapse metric)
- Reconstruction loss (ELBO components)
- Training convergence speed
- Distributional compliance (K-S test statistics)

## Key Differences from exp_20250904_180037
1. **Real Data**: Using CIFAR-10 images instead of synthetic Gaussian mixture
2. **Subset Scale**: 2,000 samples for faster iteration and validation  
3. **Image Architecture**: Convolutional encoder/decoder instead of fully-connected
4. **Validation Focus**: Testing framework robustness on real-world visual data

## Hypothesis Validation Strategy
- **H1 (Active enforcement effectiveness)**: Compare KL divergence between DERP-VAE and baselines
- **H2 (Identifiability improvement)**: Analyze latent dimension activation patterns
- **Statistical rigor**: t-tests, effect size calculations, confidence intervals
- **Replication**: Multiple random seeds for statistical validity
