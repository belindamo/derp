# CelebA Experiment Issues Summary

## Issue Severity Legend
- 🔴 **Critical**: Must fix before running experiments
- 🟡 **Moderate**: Should fix for valid results  
- 🟢 **Minor**: Nice to have improvements

## Issues by Category

### 🔴 Data Handling (Critical)
| Issue | Impact | Fix Complexity |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Wrong train/test split | Invalid results, incomparable to literature | Easy |
| Limited evaluation (50 batches) | Unreliable metrics | Easy |
| No validation set | Cannot tune hyperparameters properly | Medium |

### 🟡 Experimental Design (Moderate)
| Issue | Impact | Fix Complexity |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Single seed only | No confidence intervals | Easy |
| Limited baselines | Incomplete comparison | Easy |
| Hard-coded hyperparameters | Unfair comparison | Medium |

### 🟢 Code Quality (Minor)
| Issue | Impact | Fix Complexity |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| No checkpointing | Cannot resume/analyze | Easy |
| Missing visualizations | Less interpretable | Medium |
| No config files | Hard to reproduce | Medium |

## Most Important Fixes

### Fix #1: Data Split (2 lines of code)
```python
# WRONG (current):
full_dataset = CelebA(split='train')  # Only train!
train, test = random_split(full_dataset)  # Random split

# CORRECT:
train_dataset = CelebA(split='train')
test_dataset = CelebA(split='test')
```

### Fix #2: Evaluation (1 line removal)
```python
# Remove line 187:
if len(all_mus) < 50:  # DELETE THIS
```

### Fix #3: Multiple Seeds (10 lines)
```python
SEEDS = [42, 123, 456]
for seed in SEEDS:
    set_seeds(seed)
    # Run experiment
```

## Time Estimates

- **Critical fixes**: 30 minutes
- **All fixes**: 2-3 hours
- **Full re-run with fixes**: 4-6 hours

## Impact of Not Fixing

Without fixes:
- ❌ Results not comparable to other CelebA papers
- ❌ Metrics based on ~8% of test data
- ❌ No statistical significance
- ❌ Potential overfitting to test set

With fixes:
- ✅ Valid scientific results
- ✅ Reproducible experiments
- ✅ Fair model comparison
- ✅ Publication-ready results
