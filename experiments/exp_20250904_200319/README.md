# Experiment: exp_20250904_200319 - Enhanced DERP-VAE with CIFAR-10

**Domain**: Deep Learning - Variational Autoencoders
**Hypothesis**: H1 & H2 - Active enforcement of distributional assumptions via DERP prevents VAE posterior collapse more effectively than passive KL regularization alone
**Dataset**: CIFAR-10 subset (2000 samples) with real image data
**Method**: Enhanced DERP-VAE with multi-objective optimization on real data

## Key Improvements from Previous Experiment (exp_20250904_192729)
- **Real Data**: Switch from synthetic Gaussian mixture to CIFAR-10 subset (2000 samples)
- **Clean Implementation**: Removed outdated files while preserving enhanced multi-loss framework
- **Convolutional Architecture**: Adapted for image data (32x32x3 → latent → 32x32x3)
- **Maintained Rigor**: Preserved 4D latent space and statistical testing framework

## Research Questions
1. Can active distribution enforcement through random probe testing prevent posterior collapse on real image data?
2. Does DERP-VAE maintain reconstruction quality and classification accuracy on CIFAR-10?
3. What is the computational overhead of distributional enforcement with real data?

## Expected Outcomes
- >10% reduction in posterior collapse (measured by KL divergence to prior)
- Maintained reconstruction quality (PSNR > 15 dB)
- Classification accuracy > 60% on CIFAR-10 5-class subset
- <25% increase in training time vs baseline VAE

## Experimental Design
**Independent Variables**:
- Enforcement method: {Standard VAE, β-VAE(β=0.5), β-VAE(β=2.0), DERP-VAE(3 probes), DERP-VAE(5 probes)}
- Dataset: CIFAR-10 subset (2000 samples, 5 classes)
- Architecture: Convolutional encoder-decoder with 4D latent bottleneck

**Dependent Variables**:
- KL divergence to prior (posterior collapse metric)
- Reconstruction loss (PSNR, MSE)
- Classification accuracy on latent representations
- Training convergence speed and computational overhead
- Distributional compliance (K-S test statistics)

**Controls**:
- Same random seed across all models (42)
- Identical training hyperparameters (lr=1e-3, batch_size=64, epochs=20)
- Same data preprocessing and augmentation
- Fixed architecture capacity across all models

## Hypothesis Testing Framework
**H1: Posterior Collapse Prevention**
- Null: DERP-VAE KL divergence ≤ Standard VAE KL divergence
- Alternative: DERP-VAE reduces KL divergence by >10%
- Test: Paired t-test with effect size calculation

**H2: Performance Maintenance** 
- Null: DERP-VAE classification accuracy < Standard VAE - 5%
- Alternative: DERP-VAE maintains performance within 5% of baseline
- Test: Equivalence test with 95% confidence intervals

**H3: Real Data Validation**
- Null: DERP framework benefits do not transfer to real image data
- Alternative: DERP shows significant benefits on CIFAR-10
- Test: Statistical significance testing with multiple comparisons correction
