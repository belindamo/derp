# Experiment: exp_20250904_192729 - Enhanced DERP-VAE

**Domain**: Deep Learning - Variational Autoencoders
**Hypothesis**: H1 & H2 - Active enforcement of distributional assumptions via DERP prevents VAE posterior collapse more effectively than passive KL regularization alone
**Dataset**: Synthetic Gaussian Mixture with Labels + Multiple Loss Functions
**Method**: Enhanced DERP-VAE with multi-objective optimization

## Key Enhancements from Previous Experiment
- **Reduced Hidden Dimensions**: 32 → 4 latent dimensions for more challenging posterior collapse conditions
- **Multi-Loss Framework**: Classification + Reconstruction + Perceptual + Modified KS losses
- **Label Availability**: Synthetic dataset with ground-truth Gaussian mixture labels
- **Statistical Rigor**: Enhanced evaluation with proper null hypothesis testing

## Research Questions
1. Can active distribution enforcement through random probe testing prevent posterior collapse?
2. Does DERP-VAE maintain reconstruction quality while preventing collapse?
3. What is the computational overhead of distributional enforcement?

## Expected Outcomes
- >50% reduction in posterior collapse (measured by KL divergence to prior)
- <10% degradation in reconstruction quality
- <20% increase in training time vs baseline VAE

## Experimental Design
**Independent Variables**:
- Enforcement method: {Standard VAE, β-VAE, DERP-VAE}
- Random probe count: {1, 5, 10} projections
- Enforcement weight λ: {0.1, 0.5, 1.0}

**Dependent Variables**:
- KL divergence to prior (posterior collapse metric)
- Reconstruction loss (ELBO components)
- Training convergence speed
- Distributional compliance (K-S test statistics)
