# Experiment: exp_20250904_180037

**Domain**: Deep Learning - Variational Autoencoders
**Hypothesis**: H1 & H2 - Active enforcement of distributional assumptions via DERP prevents VAE posterior collapse more effectively than passive KL regularization alone
**Dataset**: CIFAR-10
**Method**: DERP-VAE vs Standard VAE comparison

## Research Questions
1. Can active distribution enforcement through random probe testing prevent posterior collapse?
2. Does DERP-VAE maintain reconstruction quality while preventing collapse?
3. What is the computational overhead of distributional enforcement?

## Expected Outcomes
- >50% reduction in posterior collapse (measured by KL divergence to prior)
- <10% degradation in reconstruction quality
- <20% increase in training time vs baseline VAE

## Experimental Design
**Independent Variables**:
- Enforcement method: {Standard VAE, β-VAE, DERP-VAE}
- Random probe count: {1, 5, 10} projections
- Enforcement weight λ: {0.1, 0.5, 1.0}

**Dependent Variables**:
- KL divergence to prior (posterior collapse metric)
- Reconstruction loss (ELBO components)
- Training convergence speed
- Distributional compliance (K-S test statistics)
