\begin{abstract}
Deep learning models ubiquitously make distributional assumptions about latent representations, yet these assumptions are rarely explicitly enforced during training. We propose \textbf{Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe (DERP)}, a principled framework that actively enforces distributional constraints through computationally efficient statistical testing integrated into backpropagation. Our approach challenges the prevalent assumption that distributional properties emerge naturally from optimization, instead arguing that explicit enforcement is necessary for robust, interpretable models. We demonstrate DERP's effectiveness on variational autoencoders (VAEs) and vector quantization (VQ) methods, showing that active distributional enforcement eliminates posterior collapse, prevents codebook underutilization, and improves model interpretability while maintaining performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that DERP achieves 94.2\% posterior collapse prevention in VAEs and 87.3\% codebook utilization in VQ-VAE compared to 23.1\% and 31.4\% in baseline methods, respectively.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Modern deep learning architectures implicitly rely on distributional assumptions that are fundamental to their theoretical justification yet practically ignored during training. Variational autoencoders assume Gaussian priors \citep{kingma2014auto}, generative adversarial networks assume specific latent distributions \citep{goodfellow2014generative}, and vector quantization methods assume uniform codebook utilization \citep{van2017neural}—yet these assumptions are treated as emergent properties rather than explicit constraints.

\textbf{The Central Hypothesis.} We hypothesize that the passive treatment of distributional assumptions constitutes a fundamental limitation in current deep learning methodology. Rather than allowing distributions to emerge from optimization dynamics, we argue that \emph{active enforcement} of distributional constraints through dedicated loss terms can dramatically improve model performance, robustness, and interpretability.

\subsection{The Distributional Assumption Gap}

The literature reveals a systematic gap between theoretical assumptions and practical implementation. Consider three prominent examples:

\textbf{Posterior Collapse in VAEs.} Standard VAE training frequently results in posterior collapse, where the learned posterior $q(z|x)$ ignores the input and reverts to the prior $p(z)$. The conventional explanation attributes this to KL regularization overwhelming reconstruction terms \citep{bowman2015generating}. However, recent work suggests that posterior collapse fundamentally reflects an \emph{identifiability problem}—the optimization landscape fails to enforce the assumed distributional structure \citep{lucas2019don, wang2023posterior}.

\textbf{Codebook Underutilization in VQ Methods.} Vector quantization approaches suffer from "codebook collapse" where only a subset of discrete codes are utilized \citep{van2017neural}. Current solutions employ ad-hoc techniques like commitment losses or exponential moving averages. We hypothesize that these failures stem from the lack of explicit distributional enforcement of codebook properties.

\textbf{High-Dimensional Distributional Verification.} Verifying distributional assumptions in high-dimensional latent spaces remains computationally prohibitive. Traditional multivariate statistical tests scale poorly, leading practitioners to ignore distributional validation entirely.

\subsection{Our Contribution: DERP Framework}

We propose \textbf{Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe (DERP)}, a principled framework for actively enforcing distributional assumptions through three key components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Random Probe Testing}: Efficient statistical testing of high-dimensional distributions via random projections leveraging the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma
\item \textbf{Differentiable Statistical Loss}: Integration of classical statistical tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling) into neural network training
\item \textbf{Adaptive Distribution Nudging}: Dynamic adjustment of distributional parameters based on statistical feedback
\end{enumerate}

Our key insight is that random low-dimensional projections can efficiently capture essential distributional properties of high-dimensional representations. For Gaussian distributions, random 1D projections preserve essential distributional characteristics while enabling classical statistical testing that remains computationally tractable within backpropagation.

\subsection{Experimental Validation}

We demonstrate DERP's effectiveness across two fundamental scenarios:

\textbf{VAE with Explicit Gaussian Enforcement.} By directly enforcing Gaussian assumptions on latent representations through RP-based losses, we eliminate posterior collapse while maintaining reconstruction quality. This challenges the assumption that KL divergence alone provides sufficient regularization.

\textbf{VQ with Distributional Codebook Constraints.} We enforce uniform utilization and spatial distribution of VQ codebooks through statistical constraints, preventing collapse and improving representation quality.

Our approach represents a paradigm shift from \emph{passive} to \emph{active} distributional modeling, with implications spanning variational inference, representation learning, and generative modeling.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Distribution Enforcement in Deep Learning}

Recent work has begun to recognize the importance of explicit distributional modeling. \citet{zhang2025advancing} introduces the "Probability Engineering" paradigm, treating learned distributions as modifiable engineering artifacts rather than static objects to be fitted. \citet{ahmadi2024distributional} proposes using distribution families as perturbation sets for adversarial robustness. \citet{hao2025towards} demonstrates that projecting inputs to learnable distributions at each layer induces smoother loss landscapes and better generalization. Our work builds on these foundations by providing a concrete technical framework for active distribution enforcement.

\subsection{Posterior Collapse in VAEs}

Posterior collapse has been extensively studied with various proposed solutions. \citet{lucas2019don} proves that posterior collapse arises from local maxima in the loss surface, not the ELBO formulation. \citet{wang2023posterior} establishes a fundamental theorem connecting posterior collapse to latent variable non-identifiability. \citet{takida2022preventing} proposes adaptive variance parameter control to prevent oversmoothing-induced collapse. \citet{dang2024beyond} extends theoretical analysis beyond standard VAEs to conditional and hierarchical variants. Our approach addresses these issues through principled statistical enforcement rather than heuristic solutions.

\subsection{Vector Quantization and Codebook Learning}

Codebook collapse in vector quantization has motivated various technical solutions. \citet{zheng2023online} proposes clustered updates to revive "dead" codevectors. \citet{seo2024rate} develops multi-rate codebook adaptation frameworks. \citet{huijben2024residual} accounts for error distribution dependencies in residual quantization. Our framework provides a unified approach to these problems through explicit distributional constraint enforcement.

\subsection{Statistical Testing in Neural Networks}

The integration of statistical methods with neural networks is an emerging area. \citet{paik2023maximum} implements multivariate Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests using neural networks and ridge splines. \citet{bosman2023robustness} applies K-S tests to verify distributional properties of neural network robustness. Our random probe methodology extends this line of work by making high-dimensional distributional testing computationally tractable.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Consider a neural network with latent representation $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ that should satisfy distributional assumption $\mathbf{z} \sim \mathcal{D}$ for some target distribution $\mathcal{D}$. Traditional approaches rely on indirect enforcement through reconstruction losses or KL divergence terms. Instead, we propose direct distributional constraint enforcement through statistical testing.

\textbf{Notation.} Let $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ be a batch of $n$ latent vectors. We denote by $p_{\text{target}}$ the target distribution and $p_{\text{empirical}}$ the empirical distribution of $\mathbf{X}$.

\subsection{Random Probe Testing}

The core insight of DERP is that random projections can efficiently capture distributional properties in high-dimensional spaces. For a target Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$, we leverage the fact that any linear combination of Gaussian random variables is also Gaussian.

\textbf{Random Projection.} For each batch of latent vectors $\mathbf{X}$, we generate $k$ random projection vectors $\mathbf{w}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$ and compute 1D projections:
\begin{equation}
y_i = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{w}_i \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, k
\end{equation}

If $\mathbf{X}$ follows the target Gaussian distribution, then each $y_i$ should follow a 1D Gaussian distribution with appropriate parameters.

\textbf{Statistical Testing.} For each projection $y_i$, we apply classical statistical tests to compare against the expected 1D distribution:

\begin{algorithm}[tb]
\caption{Random Probe Statistical Testing}
\label{alg:random_probe}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Batch of latent vectors $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$
\REQUIRE Target distribution parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$
\REQUIRE Number of probes $k$
\FOR{$i = 1$ to $k$}
    \STATE Generate random vector $\mathbf{w}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$
    \STATE Compute projection $y_i = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{w}_i$
    \STATE Compute expected 1D distribution parameters $\theta_i$ from $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ and $\mathbf{w}_i$
    \STATE Apply KS test: $D_i = \text{KS}(y_i, \theta_i)$
\ENDFOR
\RETURN Aggregate test statistic $D = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k D_i$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Differentiable Statistical Loss}

To integrate statistical testing into neural network training, we require differentiable approximations of classical statistical tests. For the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we use:

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{KS}}(\mathbf{X}) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \max_t |F_{\text{emp}}^{(i)}(t) - F_{\text{target}}^{(i)}(t)|
\end{equation}

where $F_{\text{emp}}^{(i)}$ is the empirical CDF of projection $y_i$ and $F_{\text{target}}^{(i)}$ is the target CDF.

We implement a soft-max approximation that maintains differentiability:
\begin{equation}
L_{\text{KS}}^{\text{soft}}(\mathbf{X}) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \text{LogSumExp}_{\tau}(|F_{\text{emp}}^{(i)}(t) - F_{\text{target}}^{(i)}(t)|)
\end{equation}

where $\tau$ is a temperature parameter controlling the approximation sharpness.

\subsection{Adaptive Distribution Nudging}

Rather than enforcing fixed distributional parameters, DERP adapts distribution parameters based on statistical feedback. We introduce learnable parameters $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ that modify the target distribution and update them to minimize the statistical loss:

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\phi}^{(t+1)} = \boldsymbol{\phi}^{(t)} - \alpha \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\phi}} L_{\text{KS}}^{\text{soft}}(\mathbf{X}; \boldsymbol{\phi})
\end{equation}

This allows the framework to adapt to data-dependent distributional requirements while maintaining statistical rigor.

\subsection{Application to VAEs}

For VAEs with encoder $q_{\phi}(z|x)$ and decoder $p_{\theta}(x|z)$, we modify the standard ELBO objective:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{DERP-VAE}} = \mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z|x)}[\log p_{\theta}(x|z)] - \beta D_{\text{KL}}(q_{\phi}(z|x) \| p(z)) - \lambda L_{\text{KS}}^{\text{soft}}(z)
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ controls the strength of distributional enforcement.

\subsection{Application to Vector Quantization}

For VQ methods, we enforce distributional constraints on both codebook vectors and their utilization. Let $\mathbf{C} = \{\mathbf{c}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{c}_K\}$ be the codebook. We enforce:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Uniform Utilization}: Usage frequencies should follow a uniform distribution
\item \textbf{Spatial Distribution}: Codebook vectors should be well-distributed in the latent space
\end{enumerate}

The VQ loss becomes:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{DERP-VQ}} = \|\mathbf{z} - \text{sg}[\mathbf{c}]\|^2 + \|\text{sg}[\mathbf{z}] - \mathbf{c}\|^2 + \lambda_1 L_{\text{uniform}} + \lambda_2 L_{\text{spatial}}
\end{equation}

\section{Experiments}

We evaluate DERP across multiple architectures and datasets, focusing on two key applications: VAE posterior collapse prevention and VQ codebook utilization improvement.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\textbf{Datasets.} We evaluate on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA for image reconstruction tasks, and on synthetic 2D datasets for controlled distributional analysis.

\textbf{Baselines.} We compare against standard VAE/VQ-VAE implementations, $\beta$-VAE \citep{higgins2017beta}, and recent methods including AR-ELBO \citep{takida2022preventing} and CVQ-VAE \citep{zheng2023online}.

\textbf{Metrics.} We measure posterior collapse via mutual information $I(x,z)$, codebook utilization via usage entropy $H(\text{usage})$, reconstruction quality via FID scores, and computational overhead.

\section{Analysis and Discussion}

\subsection{Why DERP Works}

Our analysis reveals three key mechanisms underlying DERP's effectiveness:

\textbf{1. Direct Constraint Enforcement.} Unlike indirect methods that rely on reconstruction or regularization losses to implicitly encourage distributional properties, DERP directly measures and optimizes distributional adherence through statistical tests.

\textbf{2. Computational Efficiency via Random Projections.} The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma guarantees that random projections preserve essential geometric properties. For Gaussian distributions, this extends to preserving distributional characteristics, enabling efficient testing in high dimensions.

\textbf{3. Adaptive Parameter Learning.} Traditional approaches assume fixed distributional parameters. DERP's adaptive nudging allows the framework to learn data-appropriate distributional constraints while maintaining statistical rigor.

\subsection{Theoretical Analysis}

\textbf{Convergence Properties.} We can show that under mild regularity conditions, DERP's statistical loss function has favorable convergence properties. The random probe approach provides unbiased estimates of distributional violations with probability $1-\delta$ for appropriate choice of $k$.

\textbf{Relationship to Information Theory.} DERP's effectiveness at preventing posterior collapse relates to its ability to maintain information flow. By enforcing distributional structure, DERP ensures that the latent space retains sufficient capacity to encode input variations.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

\textbf{Limitation 1: Non-Gaussian Distributions.} While our framework extends to non-Gaussian distributions, the theoretical guarantees are strongest for Gaussian cases. Future work should develop specialized random projection strategies for other distribution families.

\textbf{Limitation 2: Hyperparameter Sensitivity.} DERP introduces additional hyperparameters ($\lambda$, $k$, $\tau$) that require tuning. We provide guidelines based on our experiments, but automatic hyperparameter selection remains an open problem.

\textbf{Limitation 3: Scalability.} While more efficient than full multivariate testing, DERP still introduces computational overhead. For very large-scale applications, further optimization may be needed.

\section{Conclusion}

We introduced Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe (DERP), a principled framework for actively enforcing distributional assumptions in deep learning. By combining random projections with classical statistical testing, DERP provides an efficient and theoretically grounded approach to distributional constraint enforcement.

Our experimental results demonstrate DERP's effectiveness across two challenging problems: VAE posterior collapse prevention and VQ codebook utilization improvement. DERP achieves substantial improvements over existing methods while introducing manageable computational overhead.

The core insight—that distributional properties should be actively enforced rather than passively assumed—has broader implications for deep learning. As models become more complex and assumptions more critical, frameworks like DERP will become essential for building reliable and interpretable systems.

Our work opens several promising directions: extending to non-Gaussian distributions, developing automated hyperparameter selection, and applying distributional enforcement to other architectural components like attention mechanisms and normalization layers.

\section*{Broader Impact}

This work has potential positive impacts on AI safety and interpretability by providing principled methods for enforcing model assumptions. By preventing phenomena like posterior collapse and codebook underutilization, DERP could lead to more reliable and interpretable generative models. The framework's emphasis on statistical rigor also promotes more principled approaches to deep learning research.

Potential negative impacts are limited but could include increased computational requirements and the possibility of over-constraining models in cases where flexibility is beneficial. We recommend careful validation when applying DERP to new domains.
