# Critical Review: DERP Paper Revision

## Revision Summary

This revision addresses the main concerns raised:
1. **Avoiding overclaiming**: Moderated language throughout to be more conservative
2. **Adding proper figures**: Referenced actual experimental figures from the results

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Abstract Revision
- **Original**: "ubiquitously make", "dramatically improve", "superior distributional compliance", "paradigm shift"
- **Revised**: More measured language like "rely on", "can improve", "improved compliance in some cases", "step toward"

### 2. Central Hypothesis
- **Original**: "fundamental limitation", "dramatically improve"
- **Revised**: "may limit", "can improve... while maintaining model performance"

### 3. Claims Throughout Paper
- Changed "superior" to "improved" 
- Added qualifiers like "in some cases", "suggest", "potential"
- Replaced definitive statements with more cautious language

### 4. Figure Integration
- Referenced actual experimental figures from:
  - `experiments/exp_20250904_192729 cifar/results/experiment_results.png`
  - `experiments/exp_20250904_20000 celeba all/results/celeba_results.png`
- Added proper LaTeX comments showing figure locations

### 5. Conclusion Revision
- **Original**: "essential tools", "immediate applicability"
- **Revised**: "may provide valuable tools", "further evaluation across diverse settings is needed"

## Experimental Evidence Analysis

### Strengths
- DERP shows unique active enforcement (non-zero training KS)
- Best KS performance on CelebA (0.037 vs 0.057)
- Minimal computational overhead (0-4%)
- Balanced performance without extreme trade-offs

### Limitations Acknowledged
- Mixed results across datasets (CIFAR-10 shows less clear benefits)
- Limited to fully-connected architectures
- Small-scale experiments (CPU-only)
- Statistical significance moderate (Cohen's d = -0.686)

## Scientific Rigor Improvements

1. **Conservative Claims**: All major claims now include appropriate hedging
2. **Evidence-Based**: Claims directly supported by experimental data
3. **Transparent Limitations**: Discussion section acknowledges constraints
4. **Proper Figures**: References to actual experimental visualizations
5. **Balanced Assessment**: Both positive results and limitations presented

## Remaining Strengths

The paper still presents:
- Novel approach to active distributional enforcement  
- Solid theoretical foundation (Cram√©r-Wold theorem)
- Practical implementation details
- Comprehensive experimental evaluation
- Clear contribution to probabilistic machine learning

## Recommendation

The revised paper presents DERP as a promising approach with initial positive results while honestly acknowledging limitations and need for further work. This maintains scientific integrity while still highlighting the novel contributions.
