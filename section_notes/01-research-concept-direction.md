# Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe and Distribution Nudging

## Abstract

Deep learning models ubiquitously make distributional assumptions about latent representations, yet these assumptions are rarely explicitly enforced during training. We propose **Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe (DERP)**, a framework that actively enforces distributional constraints through computationally efficient statistical testing integrated into backpropagation. Our approach challenges the prevalent assumption that distributional properties emerge naturally from optimization, instead arguing that explicit enforcement is necessary for robust, interpretable models.

## 1. Introduction

Modern deep learning architectures implicitly rely on distributional assumptions that are fundamental to their theoretical justification yet practically ignored during training. Variational autoencoders assume Gaussian priors, generative adversarial networks assume specific latent distributions, and vector quantization methods assume uniform codebook utilization—yet these assumptions are treated as emergent properties rather than explicit constraints.

**The Central Hypothesis.** We hypothesize that the passive treatment of distributional assumptions constitutes a fundamental limitation in current deep learning methodology. Rather than allowing distributions to emerge from optimization dynamics, we argue that *active enforcement* of distributional constraints through dedicated loss terms can dramatically improve model performance, robustness, and interpretability.

### 1.1 Problem: The Distributional Assumption Gap

The literature reveals a systematic gap between theoretical assumptions and practical implementation. Consider three prominent examples:

**Posterior Collapse in VAEs.** Standard VAE training frequently results in posterior collapse, where the learned posterior q(z|x) ignores the input and reverts to the prior p(z). The conventional explanation attributes this to KL regularization overwhelming reconstruction terms. However, we hypothesize that posterior collapse fundamentally reflects an *identifiability problem*—the optimization landscape fails to enforce the assumed distributional structure.

**Codebook Underutilization in VQ Methods.** Vector quantization approaches suffer from "codebook collapse" where only a subset of discrete codes are utilized. Current solutions employ ad-hoc techniques like commitment losses or exponential moving averages. We hypothesize that these failures stem from the lack of explicit distributional enforcement of codebook properties.

**High-Dimensional Distributional Verification.** Verifying distributional assumptions in high-dimensional latent spaces remains computationally prohibitive. Traditional multivariate statistical tests scale poorly, leading practitioners to ignore distributional validation entirely.

### 1.2 Insight: Random Probe for Distributional Enforcement via Simulated Annealing Dynamics

We propose that random low-dimensional projections can efficiently capture essential distributional properties of high-dimensional representations through a **temperature-driven statistical testing framework**. Like simulated annealing, our approach begins with high-temperature random initialization of distributional probes and gradually converges to stable distributional constraints through controlled cooling of acceptance thresholds.

**Random Probe (RP)** leverages the **Cramer-Wold theorem**: if all one-dimensional linear projections ⟨X,θ⟩ are Gaussian, then the multivariate distribution X is also Gaussian. This provides theoretical foundation for distributional testing via random one-dimensional projections.

Our key insight extends beyond classical statistical testing: **Modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance using average rather than maximum deviation** provides smoother gradients for backpropagation while maintaining statistical power. This average-based distance metric facilitates faster convergence during distributional enforcement by avoiding the non-differentiable maximum operation inherent in classical K-S tests.

### 1.3 Technical Contribution: DERP Framework

**Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe (DERP)** provides a principled framework for actively enforcing distributional assumptions through three components:

1. **Random Probe Testing**: Efficient statistical testing of high-dimensional distributions via random projections
2. **Differentiable Statistical Loss**: Integration of classical statistical tests (KS, Anderson-Darling) into neural network training
3. **Adaptive Distribution Nudging**: Dynamic adjustment of distributional parameters based on statistical feedback

### 1.4 Validation and Impact

We demonstrate DERP's effectiveness across two fundamental scenarios:

**VAE with Explicit Gaussian Enforcement.** By directly enforcing Gaussian assumptions on latent representations through RP-based losses, we eliminate posterior collapse while maintaining reconstruction quality. This challenges the assumption that KL divergence alone provides sufficient regularization.

**VQ with Distributional Codebook Constraints.** We enforce uniform utilization and spatial distribution of VQ codebooks through statistical constraints, preventing collapse and improving representation quality.

Our approach represents a paradigm shift from *passive* to *active* distributional modeling, with implications spanning variational inference, representation learning, and generative modeling.

## Research Methodology Notes

## Section 2. Enhanced Technical Framework

### 2.1 Simulated Annealing-Inspired Distributional Enforcement

Building on simulated annealing principles, we introduce a temperature-driven framework for distributional constraints. The approach begins with high-temperature random initialization of distributional probes, allowing wide deviations from target distributions. As the system "cools," acceptance thresholds become more stringent, gradually enforcing stricter distributional compliance.

This annealing-inspired approach mirrors physical systems where random thermal motion gradually settles into stable energy configurations. In our distributional context, statistical probes initially explore diverse distributional states before converging to the desired target distribution through controlled constraint tightening.

### 2.2 Modified K-S Distance for Differentiability

Instead of classical maximum-based Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance:
D\_max \= max\_x |F₁(x) - F₂(x)|

We employ average-based distance for smooth backpropagation:
D\_avg \= ∫ |F₁(x) - F₂(x)| dx / ∫ dx * sqrt(n)

This modification enables gradient-based optimization while preserving statistical discrimination power, facilitating faster convergence.

### 2.3 Theoretical Foundation for Random Projections

**Cramer-Wold Characterization**: We leverage the fundamental theorem that multivariate normality is characterized by the normality of all one-dimensional linear projections. This provides direct theoretical justification for using random one-dimensional projections in distributional testing.

This theoretical foundation motivates our focus on one-dimensional rather than higher-dimensional random projections for computational efficiency while maintaining statistical power.

### 2.4 Enhanced DERP Loss Function

ℒ\_DERP \= ℒ\_reconstruction + β\_KL · ℒ\_KL + λ\_T(t) · D\_avg(q(**z**|**x**), p(**z**))

where λ\_T(t) \= λ₀/τ(t) increases enforcement strength as temperature cools, ensuring gradual transition from exploration to exploitation in the distributional constraint space.
