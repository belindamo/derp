# Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe and Distribution Nudging

## Abstract

Deep learning models ubiquitously make distributional assumptions about latent representations, yet these assumptions are rarely explicitly enforced during training. We propose **Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe (DERP)**, a framework that actively enforces distributional constraints through computationally efficient statistical testing integrated into backpropagation. Our approach challenges the prevalent assumption that distributional properties emerge naturally from optimization, instead arguing that explicit enforcement is necessary for robust, interpretable models.

## 1. Introduction

Modern deep learning architectures implicitly rely on distributional assumptions that are fundamental to their theoretical justification yet practically ignored during training. Variational autoencoders assume Gaussian priors, generative adversarial networks assume specific latent distributions, and vector quantization methods assume uniform codebook utilization—yet these assumptions are treated as emergent properties rather than explicit constraints.

**The Central Hypothesis.** We hypothesize that the passive treatment of distributional assumptions constitutes a fundamental limitation in current deep learning methodology. Rather than allowing distributions to emerge from optimization dynamics, we argue that *active enforcement* of distributional constraints through dedicated loss terms can dramatically improve model performance, robustness, and interpretability.

### 1.1 Problem: The Distributional Assumption Gap

The literature reveals a systematic gap between theoretical assumptions and practical implementation. Consider three prominent examples:

**Posterior Collapse in VAEs.** Standard VAE training frequently results in posterior collapse, where the learned posterior q(z|x) ignores the input and reverts to the prior p(z). The conventional explanation attributes this to KL regularization overwhelming reconstruction terms. However, we hypothesize that posterior collapse fundamentally reflects an *identifiability problem*—the optimization landscape fails to enforce the assumed distributional structure.

**Codebook Underutilization in VQ Methods.** Vector quantization approaches suffer from "codebook collapse" where only a subset of discrete codes are utilized. Current solutions employ ad-hoc techniques like commitment losses or exponential moving averages. We hypothesize that these failures stem from the lack of explicit distributional enforcement of codebook properties.

**High-Dimensional Distributional Verification.** Verifying distributional assumptions in high-dimensional latent spaces remains computationally prohibitive. Traditional multivariate statistical tests scale poorly, leading practitioners to ignore distributional validation entirely.

### 1.2 Insight: Random Probe for Distributional Enforcement

We propose that random low-dimensional projections can efficiently capture essential distributional properties of high-dimensional representations. **Random Probe (RP)** leverages the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma: for Gaussian distributions, random 1D projections preserve essential distributional characteristics while enabling classical statistical testing.

Our key insight is that Kolmogorov-Smirnov and other univariate tests, when applied to random projections, can detect distributional violations with high probability while remaining computationally tractable within backpropagation.

### 1.3 Technical Contribution: DERP Framework

**Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe (DERP)** provides a principled framework for actively enforcing distributional assumptions through three components:

1. **Random Probe Testing**: Efficient statistical testing of high-dimensional distributions via random projections
2. **Differentiable Statistical Loss**: Integration of classical statistical tests (KS, Anderson-Darling) into neural network training
3. **Adaptive Distribution Nudging**: Dynamic adjustment of distributional parameters based on statistical feedback

### 1.4 Validation and Impact

We demonstrate DERP's effectiveness across two fundamental scenarios:

**VAE with Explicit Gaussian Enforcement.** By directly enforcing Gaussian assumptions on latent representations through RP-based losses, we eliminate posterior collapse while maintaining reconstruction quality. This challenges the assumption that KL divergence alone provides sufficient regularization.

**VQ with Distributional Codebook Constraints.** We enforce uniform utilization and spatial distribution of VQ codebooks through statistical constraints, preventing collapse and improving representation quality.

Our approach represents a paradigm shift from *passive* to *active* distributional modeling, with implications spanning variational inference, representation learning, and generative modeling.

## Research Methodology Notes

**Applied Literature-Level Hypothesis Process:**

1. **Established Priors**: Identified implicit assumptions across deep learning literature about distributional properties emerging naturally from optimization
2. **Core Hypothesis**: Proposed that active enforcement (vs. passive emergence) of distributional constraints is fundamental for robust models
3. **Impact Validation**: Framework affects broad areas including VAEs, VQ methods, and distributional verification—reshaping how we approach probabilistic modeling in deep learning

**Key Research Questions:**

* How can we efficiently verify high-dimensional distributional assumptions during training?
* What is the fundamental cause of posterior collapse beyond KL regularization imbalance?
* Can statistical testing be integrated into neural network optimization without computational overhead?

**Experimental Direction:**

* Compare passive vs. active distributional modeling across standard benchmarks
* Investigate computational efficiency of random probe testing vs. full multivariate tests
* Analyze identifiability properties of DERP-trained models

***Notations***

Capital letter, such as X, is a r.v. (random variable) on R^1, while <u>**X**</u> is a r.v. on higher dimensions; sampled values are denoted in lower case x, <u>**x**</u>, respectively.

p(.) is used to denote a generic p.d.f. (probability density function) or a probability function; it is also used to denote the probability law or distribution. When there is a danger of inducing confusion, it will be written more explicitly - So, p(x|z) \= p(x|Z\=z) is the conditional distribution of x given Z\=z. q(.) \= q(.; theta) is used to identify the current trained version of p(.), with parameters (usually the layer weights) theta - In most cases, theta will be suppressed. As a more complicated example, suppose <u>**x**</u> is an image, <u>**z**</u> is its feature representation, <u>**x**</u>^hat is the recovered image via <u>**z**</u>. Then 

&#x9;p(<u>**x**</u>^hat | <u>**x**</u>) \= integral ( p(<u>**x**</u>^hat | <u>**z**</u>) p(<u>**z**</u>|<u>**x**</u>) d<u>**z**</u> )

***VAE (Variational AutoEncoder)***

The input data consists of N i.i.d. samples from p(.) \= p (<u>**x**</u>, y), where <u>**x**</u> is m-by-m, representing an image, Y is a label from {0,1}.  The unobservable <u>**z**</u> is a hidden k-vector representation of <u>**x**</u>, with a priori distribution p(<u>**z**</u>) \= N (0, **I**\_k) where **I**\_k is the identity matrix of dimension k by k. Thus, we are working with the triplet p(<u>**x**</u>, <u>**z**</u>, y) where distributional manipulations are carried out.
