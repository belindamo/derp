Nice. for the next experiment, duplicate experiments experiments/exp\_20250904\_192729 into a new experiments/exp\_<id> folder, to improve the experiment. Remember, we enhanced it (per the summary below), but now it is somewhat cluttered with old and new files. It is also still uses synthetic data.

Please:

1. remove outdated files (be cautious)
2. instead of using synthetic data, use 2000 lines from the CIFAR dataset! So that we are using real data and can validate more quickly it works with a subset of CIFAR
