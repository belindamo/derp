### Model Performance Comparison

| Model | KL Divergence | Classification Accuracy | KS Distance | Activation Rate | Training Time (s) |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| **Standard VAE** | 35.26 | 60.50% | 0.000 | 99.44% | 2403.86 |
| **β-VAE (β=0.1)** | 134.05 | **71.44%** | 0.000 | 86.23% | 3475.63 |
| **DERP-VAE (5 probes)** | 35.87 | 62.63% | **0.069** | 99.23% | 3186.63 |

### Key Findings

1. **β-VAE with Low Beta (0.1)**: Achieved highest classification accuracy (71.44%) but at the cost of severe posterior collapse (KL=134.05)
2. **DERP-VAE Performance**: Maintained similar KL divergence to standard VAE while slightly improving classification accuracy
3. **KS Distance**: Only DERP-VAE showed non-zero KS distance (0.069), indicating active distributional enforcement
4. **Computational Cost**: DERP-VAE showed 32.6% overhead compared to standard VAE
5. **Activation Rate**: Both Standard VAE and DERP-VAE maintained high activation rates (~99%), while β-VAE (β=0.1) dropped to 86%
