# Experiment Ideas: Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe (DERP)

## Research Methodology Framework

Following Stanford research methodology, our experiments test literature-level hypotheses about active vs. passive distributional modeling. Each experiment follows the structure:
1. **Clear thesis statement** with testable hypotheses
2. **Assumptions** being challenged from prior work
3. **Independent variables** (what we manipulate) 
4. **Dependent variables** (what we measure)
5. **Validity threats** and mitigation strategies
6. **Resource requirements** and expected timeline

## Experimental Constraints

* Input data conforms with VAE paper specifications
* Algorithms must implement DERP framework from sections 1-2
* Focus on engineering properties: convergence speed, result quality
* Optional ablation studies for deeper analysis
* Multiple hyperparameter tuning runs expected
* VAE paper and package provided as reference implementation

## Core Experiments

### Experiment 1: VAE Posterior Collapse Prevention via Active Distribution Enforcement

**Thesis Statement**: Active enforcement of Gaussian assumptions through DERP random probe testing prevents posterior collapse more effectively than passive KL regularization alone.

**Research Hypothesis Being Tested**: 
- H2: "Posterior collapse is fundamentally an identifiability and optimization problem, not just regularization imbalance"
- H1: "Active enforcement of distributional assumptions via dedicated loss terms can improve model performance and robustness"

**Experimental Design**:
- **Independent Variables**:
  - Enforcement method: {Passive (standard VAE), Active (DERP-VAE)}
  - Temperature schedule: {Fixed, Exponential decay, Linear decay}
  - Random probe count: {1, 5, 10, 20 projections}
  - Enforcement weight λ: {0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0}

- **Dependent Variables**:
  - Posterior collapse metrics: KL divergence to prior, mutual information I(x,z)
  - Reconstruction quality: ELBO, reconstruction loss, perceptual metrics
  - Convergence speed: epochs to convergence, training time
  - Distributional compliance: K-S test statistics on latent representations

**Datasets**: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA (increasing complexity)

**Experimental Procedure**:
1. **Baseline**: Train standard VAE with β-VAE variants (β ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 2.0})
2. **DERP-VAE**: Train with random probe enforcement using modified K-S distance
3. **Temperature Ablation**: Compare different cooling schedules
4. **Probe Count Study**: Evaluate efficiency vs. accuracy trade-offs

**Success Metrics**:
- Posterior collapse prevention: Active enforcement reduces KL collapse by >50%
- Reconstruction maintenance: <10% degradation in reconstruction quality
- Efficiency: <20% increase in training time vs. baseline VAE

**Validity Threats & Mitigations**:
- **Selection bias**: Use standard benchmarks with fixed train/test splits
- **Implementation effects**: Identical architecture except for DERP components
- **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: Grid search with cross-validation

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (1 week implementation, 2 weeks experimentation)

### Experiment 2: Vector Quantization Codebook Optimization via Distributional Constraints

**Thesis Statement**: Explicit enforcement of uniform codebook utilization through statistical constraints prevents codebook collapse and improves representation quality compared to heuristic methods.

**Research Hypothesis Being Tested**:

- **Evaluation metrics**: Multiple orthogonal quality measures

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (similar to Experiment 1)

### Experiment 3: Computational Efficiency of Random Probe Testing

**Thesis Statement**: Random projection-based distributional testing provides comparable statistical power to full multivariate methods at significantly lower computational cost.

**Research Hypothesis Being Tested**:
