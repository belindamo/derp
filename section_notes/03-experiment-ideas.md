# Experiment Ideas: Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe (DERP)

## Experimental Constraints

* Input data conforms with VAE paper specifications
* Algorithms must implement DERP framework from sections 1-2
* Focus on engineering properties: convergence speed, result quality
* Optional ablation studies for deeper analysis
* Multiple hyperparameter tuning runs expected
* VAE paper and package provided as reference implementation

## Core Experiments

### Experiment 1: VAE Posterior Collapse Prevention via Active Distribution Enforcement

**Thesis Statement**: Active enforcement of Gaussian assumptions through DERP random probe testing prevents posterior collapse more effectively than passive KL regularization alone.

**Research Hypothesis Being Tested**:

* H2: "Posterior collapse is fundamentally an identifiability and optimization problem, not just regularization imbalance"
* H1: "Active enforcement of distributional assumptions via dedicated loss terms can improve model performance and robustness"

**Experimental Design**:

* **Independent Variables**:
  * Enforcement method: {Passive (standard VAE), Active (DERP-VAE)}
  * Random probe count: {1, 5, 10, 20 projections}
  * Enforcement weight λ: {0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0}
* **Dependent Variables**:
  * Posterior collapse metrics: KL divergence to prior, mutual information I(x,z)
  * Reconstruction quality: ELBO, reconstruction loss, perceptual metrics
  * Convergence speed: epochs to convergence, training time
  * Distributional compliance: K-S test statistics on latent representations

**Datasets**: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA (increasing complexity)

**Experimental Procedure**:

1. **Baseline**: Train standard VAE with β-VAE variants (β ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 2.0})
2. **DERP-VAE**: Train with random probe enforcement using modified K-S distance
3. **Probe Count Study**: Evaluate efficiency vs. accuracy trade-offs

**Success Metrics**:

* Posterior collapse prevention: Active enforcement reduces KL collapse by >50%
* Reconstruction maintenance: <10% degradation in reconstruction quality
* Efficiency: <20% increase in training time vs. baseline VAE

**Validity Threats & Mitigations**:

* **Selection bias**: Use standard benchmarks with fixed train/test splits
* **Implementation effects**: Identical architecture except for DERP components
* **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: Grid search with cross-validation



### Experiment 2: Vector Quantization Codebook Optimization via Distributional Constraints

**Thesis Statement**: Explicit enforcement of uniform codebook utilization through statistical constraints prevents codebook collapse and improves representation quality compared to heuristic methods.

**Research Hypothesis Being Tested**:

* H4: "VQ codebooks suffer from distributional mismatch and require explicit distributional enforcement for optimal performance"
* H9: "Clustered codebook updates using distributional awareness can prevent collapse and improve coverage"

**Experimental Design**:

* **Independent Variables**:
  * Update method: {Standard VQ, EMA-VQ, DERP-VQ}
  * Uniformity enforcement: {None, L2 penalty, Statistical constraint}
  * Codebook size: {64, 256, 512, 1024}
  * Spatial distribution constraint: {None, Minimum distance, Statistical spacing}
* **Dependent Variables**:
  * Codebook utilization: Percentage of active codes, entropy of usage distribution
  * Reconstruction quality: MSE, perceptual similarity, codebook commitment
  * Training stability: Convergence rate, loss variance
  * Representation quality: Downstream classification accuracy, interpolation smoothness

**Datasets**: CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32, speech spectrograms (diverse modalities)

**Experimental Procedure**:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Standard VQ-VAE vs. EMA-based variants
2. **DERP-VQ Implementation**: Statistical uniformity constraints via K-S testing
3. **Codebook Size Scaling**: Evaluate scalability across different codebook sizes
4. **Multi-modal Validation**: Test generalizability across image and audio domains

**Success Metrics**:

* Utilization improvement: >80% active codebook utilization vs. <50% baseline
* Quality maintenance: Equivalent or better reconstruction quality
* Stability: Reduced training variance, faster convergence

**Validity Threats & Mitigations**:

* **Architecture confounds**: Control for network capacity and training procedures
* **Dataset bias**: Validate across multiple domains and scales
* **Evaluation metrics**: Multiple orthogonal quality measures

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (similar to Experiment 1)

### Experiment 3: Computational Efficiency of Random Probe Testing

**Thesis Statement**: Random projection-based distributional testing provides comparable statistical power to full multivariate methods at significantly lower computational cost.

**Research Hypothesis Being Tested**:

* H3: "Random projections to 1D followed by classical statistical tests can effectively verify high-dimensional distributions"
* H11: "Random projections preserve essential statistical properties beyond distance, enabling distributional testing in high dimensions"

**Experimental Design**:

* **Independent Variables**:
  * Testing method: {Full multivariate, Random projections, PCA projections}
  * Projection count: {1, 5, 10, 20, 50}
  * Dimensionality: {10, 50, 100, 500, 1000}
  * Distribution type: {Gaussian, Mixture, Uniform, Heavy-tailed}
* **Dependent Variables**:
  * Statistical power: True positive rate for detecting distribution deviations
  * Type I error: False positive rate under null hypothesis
  * Computational time: Wall-clock time, FLOPS
  * Memory usage: Peak memory consumption

**Datasets**: Synthetic distributions with known ground truth, real latent representations from trained models

**Experimental Procedure**:

1. **Synthetic Validation**: Test with controlled deviations from target distributions
2. **Real Data Testing**: Apply to actual VAE latent spaces
3. **Scaling Analysis**: Measure computational complexity vs. dimensionality
4. **Power Analysis**: ROC curves for different projection strategies

**Success Metrics**:

* Efficiency: >90% computational reduction vs. full multivariate testing
* Statistical validity: Maintain >80% statistical power with <5% Type I error
* Scalability: Linear or sub-linear scaling with dimensionality

**Validity Threats & Mitigations**:

* **Ground truth availability**: Use synthetic data with known deviations
* **Method implementation**: Consistent statistical testing procedures
* **Hardware variability**: Average across multiple runs and platforms

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks (primarily computational experiments)
