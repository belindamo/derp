# Experiment Ideas: Distribution Enforcement via Random Probe (DERP)

## Experimental Constraints

* Input data conforms with VAE paper specifications
* Algorithms must implement DERP framework from sections 1-2
* Focus on engineering properties: convergence speed, result quality
* Optional ablation studies for deeper analysis
* Multiple hyperparameter tuning runs expected
* VAE paper and package provided as reference implementation

## Core Experiment

### Experiment 1: VAE Posterior Collapse Prevention via Active Distribution Enforcement

**Thesis Statement**: Active enforcement of Gaussian assumptions through DERP random probe testing prevents posterior collapse more effectively than passive KL regularization alone.

**Research Hypothesis Being Tested**:

* H2: "Posterior collapse is fundamentally an identifiability and optimization problem, not just regularization imbalance"
* H1: "Active enforcement of distributional assumptions via dedicated loss terms can improve model performance and robustness"

**Experimental Design**:

* **Independent Variables**:
  * Enforcement method: {Passive (standard VAE), Active (DERP-VAE)}
  * Random probe count: {1, 5, 10, 20 projections}
  * Enforcement weight λ: {0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0}
* **Dependent Variables**:
  * Posterior collapse metrics: KL divergence to prior, mutual information I(x,z)
  * Reconstruction quality: ELBO, reconstruction loss, perceptual metrics
  * Convergence speed: epochs to convergence, training time
  * Distributional compliance: K-S test statistics on latent representations
  * Classification cross-entropy loss and accuracy

**Datasets**: CIFAR

**Experimental Procedure**:

1. **Baseline**: Train standard VAE with β-VAE variants (β ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 2.0})
2. **DERP-VAE**: Train with random probe enforcement using modified K-S distance
3. **Probe Count Study**: Evaluate efficiency vs. accuracy trade-offs

**Success Metrics**:

* Posterior collapse prevention: Active enforcement reduces KL collapse by >50%
* Reconstruction maintenance: <10% degradation in reconstruction quality
* Efficiency: <20% increase in training time vs. baseline VAE

**Validity Threats & Mitigations**:

* **Selection bias**: Use standard benchmarks with fixed train/test splits
* **Implementation effects**: Identical architecture except for DERP components
* **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: Grid search with cross-validation
