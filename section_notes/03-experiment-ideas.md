experiment constraints

* input data conforms with VAE paper
* algorithm must confirm with what we put down in section 1 and 2

the experiments should showcase the idea. be able to run and demonstrate some engineering properties like speed of convergence and quality of result. optional is ablation studies

there may be some multiple runs for tuning the hyperparameters&#x20;



we will give you the whole VAE paper and package for refere
