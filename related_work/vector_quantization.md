## Key Insights for DERP Framework

### Current Challenges in VQ

1. **Codebook Collapse**: Only subset of codevectors get updated, reducing effective codebook size

3. **Gradient Issues**: STE doesn't properly account for quantization effects
4. **Limited Verification**: No systematic way to verify codebook distribution properties

### Distributional Assumptions in VQ

1. **Uniform Distribution Assumption**: Classical VQ assumes uniform source distribution
2. **Independence Assumption**: Codevectors typically assumed independent
3. **Spherical Assumption**: Often assumes spherical clusters in latent space
