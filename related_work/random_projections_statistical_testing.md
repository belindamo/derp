## Research Gaps and Opportunities

### Current Limitations
1. **Limited Integration**: Statistical testing and neural optimization remain largely separate
2. **Scalability Questions**: Most work limited to specific architectures or datasets
3. **Theoretical Gaps**: Connection between random projection theory and neural network distributions unclear

### DERP Contributions
1. **Unified Framework**: Integrates random projections, statistical testing, and neural optimization
2. **Practical Implementation**: Shows how classical statistical tests can be embedded in training
3. **Broad Applicability**: Demonstrates approach across VAE and VQ contexts

## Implementation Considerations

### Projection Dimension Selection
- Traditional rules: O(ε^{-2} log n) for JL lemma
- Statistical testing: depends on desired power and significance level
- DERP approach: adaptive selection based on convergence of statistical tests

### Computational Efficiency
- Random projections: O(dk) for k projections to d dimensions
- Statistical tests: O(n) for most univariate tests
- Neural integration: negligible overhead when using differentiable implementations

### Theoretical Guarantees
- Preservation of distributional properties depends on:
  - Projection dimension
  - Number of projections
  - Underlying distributional assumptions
- DERP provides probabilistic guarantees via statistical test theory

## Future Directions

1. **Theoretical Analysis**: Deeper understanding of when random projections preserve specific distributional properties
2. **Adaptive Methods**: Dynamic selection of projection dimensions and test parameters
3. **Multi-Scale Testing**: Hierarchical random projections for different granularity levels
4. **Continuous Verification**: Real-time distributional monitoring during training
